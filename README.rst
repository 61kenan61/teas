Includes tools to:

* Extract 1D spectra from 3D IFU data cubes from NIRSpec and MIRI MRS
* Create images of spectrally imaged regions using NIRCam data
* Align and reproject the WCS of data cubes and images
* Find the field of view of NIRSpec or MIRI MRS data products within NIRCam images
* Fit the continuum using either an anchors-and-splines fitting or  linear regression
* Stitch together spectra
* Shift, scale, and normalize spectrum flux
